PLCnext Libraries that can be used. These are unofficial libraries. See [my profile](https://github.com/declan-pxc) for how to get in contact.

## SMTP
The SMTP library allows for emails to be sent through SMTP.
It utilises the smtplib python library to send emails. The PLCnext library contains tools to save configurations and save files that the python script uses.
The library also contains visualisation and debugging objects.

## [ISA 101](isa-101)
The ISA 101 library is created to provide resources to easily build process projects with pre-made Datatypes, Function Blocks and HMI objects. These are designed to work together to provide consistent project development and operation.
